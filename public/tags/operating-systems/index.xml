      <description>Introduction to Real-Time Operating Systems A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is an operating system designed to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. The key characteristic of an RTOS is its ability to provide a predictable response time to external events, which is crucial in environments where timing is critical.
Key Features of RTOS Deterministic Timing: RTOS guarantees that high-priority tasks will receive CPU time at predictable intervals.</description>
